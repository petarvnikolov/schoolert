# Introduction

Schoolert is a modern school announcement system, based on a PWA, built with .NET and Blazor WASM. This is a thesis project for my high-school diploma.

Students and teachers or school admins can install the app from their browser and send important school announcements as a notification.

It functions based on authentication and user roles to determine the rights they have to send or recieve certain notifications.

# Developement

First you need to clone the repo to a folder

In order to run the debugger or enable Hot-Reloading, you need to run them in the `Schoolert.Server` environment.
